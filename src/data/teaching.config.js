                "Behavioral Economics (aka 'Psychology and Economics') is a growing sub-field of economics that incorporates insights from psychology and other social sciences into economics. The broad goal of these efforts is to make economic models more realistic and to strengthen their predictive power by incorporating previously neglected features such as self-control issues, concerns for others, or aversion to losses.",
                "This course reviews some of the assumptions made in mainstream economic models and discusses how human behavior systematically departs from these assumptions. Although we will question several assumptions of standard microeconomic models, we will not cast away the fundamental tools and techniques of mainstream economics. We will continue to rely on individual-based, utility-driven models, mathematical formalization of assumptions, and theories that can be tested with data. Our goal is to understand how predictions of behavior—and implications for markets—are altered when certain common assumptions are reconsidered.",
                "Topics include deviations from the standard model in terms of (i) preferences (present bias, reference dependence, and social preferences), (ii) beliefs (projection bias), and (iii) decision-making (cognition, attention, and framing), as well as (iv) market and policy reactions to such deviations. Applications will cover a wide range of fields, including labor and public economics, industrial organization, health economics, finance, and development economics."

                "This course explores social and economic development around the world. The focus is on the following themes: income, poverty, inequality, human development, geography, growth, impact evaluation, health, education, financial markets, and trade.",
                "The first part of the course aims to understand, measure, and analyze four key elements of economic development: income, poverty, inequality, and human development. Then, the course considers geography and economic growth theory and analyzes what are the determinants of economic growth.",
                "The second part of the course focuses on major policy issues concerning health, education, credit, savings, gender differences and globalization. We study which interventions worked and did not. We draw on readings and perspectives from several academic disciplines throughout the course under one unifying methodological theme: the usefulness of empirical economic tools in assessing the arguments presented in debates about development."
